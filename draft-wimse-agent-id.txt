1.  Introduction

2.  Basic Architecture

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   The proposed architecture enables the secure acquisition and
   management of agent identity credentialsï¼Œwhich established a
   foundation for agent zero-trust access.  Key components include:

   Trust Domain: a logical grouping of systems that share a common set
   of security controls and policies.  Agent credentials are issued
   under the authority of a trust domain.

   Agent: the autonomous software entity running on a device that
   initiates the credential request.  Agents operate independently and
   are responsible for authenticating themselves and requesting
   appropriate credentials within a trust domain.

   Identity server: A trust entity issuing the agent identity
   credential, which serves as the root of trust for a trust domain.
   For simplicity, this document sometimes uses the term of "server" to
   indicate the identity server.

   Identity proxy: an intermediary component on the device that can
   request, inspect, replace or augment agent identity credentials.  It
   exposes an Agent API locally to agents running on the device.  For
   simplicity, this document sometimes uses the term of "proxy" to
   indicate the identity proxy.
